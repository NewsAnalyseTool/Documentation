# Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for each component of our news analysis tool.

The documentation for a component may have been subdivided further. Here are a few links that will take you directly to the documentation of the individual components:
- WebInterface (Front- and Back-End)
- Tagesschau Crawler
- Reddit Crawler
- New York Times Crawler
